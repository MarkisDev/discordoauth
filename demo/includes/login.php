# IMPORTANT READ THIS:
# - This requires 'guilds.join' scope to be active in url() function in index.php
# - The below function requries the client to be a BOT application with CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE permissions to be a member in the server.
# - Set the `$bot_token` to your bot token if you want to use guilds.join scope in the init() function
# - The below function HAS to be called after get_user() as it adds the user who has logged in
# - The bot DOES NOT have to be online, just a member in the server.
# - Uncomment line 35 to enable the function
