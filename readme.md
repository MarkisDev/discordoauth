# MemberMouse Discord Oauth
Wordpress plugin that adds a [join_discord] shortcode which depending on if the member is logged in with valid membership and hasn't already linked their discord account will display the login with discord link.

When the member is returned to the website from Discord's auth page, their membership status is checked before adding them to the Discord server, granting them a specified role in the server and redirecting them to a success page.
